# Tennis Kata: Typescript, Jasmine and BDD

This Kata provides a starting point for practicing *Behavior Driven Development* (BDD) with *Typescript* as programming language and
*Jasmine* to specify the tests.

## Preparation 

### Prepare the system

To build and run this project you need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). 

### Get the dev environment ready

1. Open a console at the root of your local repository (where this README is placed)

1. Run ```npm install```.
    Npm is node's package manager. "npm install" downloads all node modules specified in package.json.
    The modules are stored into the folder "node_modules".
    The modules are needed for building this project and executing the tests.

1. Run ```grunt init```
    [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a javscript task runner. 
    The tasks are defined in GruntFile.js. The "init" task will download
    Typescript declaration files (d.ts) specified in tsd.json.

1. Run ```grunt```
    This will run the default "watch" task. 
    On a source file change (*.ts) the files are compiled and the tests are executed.

1. The kata comes with the following files:

  - TennisGame.ts - The given interface for this kata. Should not be modified.
  - TennisGameImpl.ts - The implementation of the TennisGame interface goes here.
  - TennisGameSpec.ts - The test code goes here.
  
1. Edit "TennisGameImpl.ts" by modifying the return value. 
   Look at your console: The file is compiled and the tests are run.
   You should see that one test fails.


## The Tennis Kata
Tennis has a rather quirky scoring system, and to newcomers it can be a little difficult to keep track of. The tennis society has contracted you to build a scoreboard to display the current score during tennis games. 

Your task is to write a “TennisGame” class containing the logic which outputs the correct score as a string for display on the scoreboard. When a player scores a point, it triggers a method to be called on your class letting you know who scored the point. Later, you will get a call “score()” from the scoreboard asking what it should display. This method should return a string with the current score.

You can read more about Tennis scores [at wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system#Game_score) which is summarized below:

1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to four points are described as "love", "15", "30", "40" and "Game" respectively. 
3. If both players have won the same number of points but less than three points, the score is described as "love-all", "15-all" and "30-all". If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".
4. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "Advantage" for the player in the lead.

You need only report the score for the current game. Sets and Matches are out of scope.

### Examples
- If the game has just begun, the score is "love-all".
- If the first player has won one point and second none, the score is "15-love".
- If the first player is named "A" and has won four points and the second player has won three points, the score is "Advantage A".
- If the first player is named "A" and has won five points and the second player has won three points, player "A" has won the game. 
The score is "Game A".
